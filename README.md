# About the Project
This project builds a Movie Recommendation System using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It analyzes movie descriptions, reviews, or metadata to recommend similar films. The system leverages TF-IDF, Count Vectorizer, and Cosine Similarity for text-based recommendations. Implemented in Python with libraries like NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy, the model enhances user experience by providing personalized movie suggestions.
